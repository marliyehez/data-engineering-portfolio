In this project, we performed web scraping using `Pandas` on the en.chessbase.com site, performed ETL process to get a list of the top 10 best chess grandmasters in 2021, transformed the data, and then saved it into `PostgreSQL`.

After that, an ETL process was carried out again to update the rankings of the previous 10 best chess Grandmasters in 2021 for 2022.

Created a databases design using `PostgreSQL` and `SQLAlchemy` that represents transactions that occur in a photocopy shop. Star schema was used in the design, which is a type of schema that is  usually made to model a data warehouse system. The schema creates relationships between 3 dimenssion tables to a fact table.

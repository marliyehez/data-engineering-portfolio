Performed data analysis using `Pyspark` either by `SparkRDD` or `SparkSQL` techniques. All data in this project is obtained from kaggle.com.

Using `SparkRDD`, analysis of daily transaction data at French Bakery was performed. In the same file, we tried to find the most common words in Instagram app reviews based on 'good' or 'bad' ratings.

Using `SparkSQL`, we tried to find relationships between several predictor variables to give us insight into whether students will go on to college or not.
